description: It is a method to use DAS Tool(v1.1.1) to integrate the results of five binners (CONCOCT V1.1.0, MetaBAT V2.12.1, MetaBinner, MaxBin V2.2.6 and SolidBin V1.2) to calculate an optimized, non-redundant set of bins.In MetaBinner,contigs_length_threshold we use to run "run.sh" is 0 and the cluster number is estimated by single-copy genes. For MaxBin, we only use the the short read samples. For SolidBin, we use the SolidBin-SFS-CL model.
samples used: the gold standard assembly of Simulated long read and short read shotgun metagenome data, including a large amount of strain-level variation.
