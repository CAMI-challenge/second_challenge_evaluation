description: It is a method to use DAS Tool(v1.1.1) to integrate the results of three binners (CONCOCT V1.1.0, MetaBAT V2.12.1, MetaBinner) to calculate an optimized, non-redundant set of bins.
samples used: simulated short read and long read shotgun metagenome data from samples at different seafloor locations of a marine environment, the gold standard assembly.
