		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 3925.0, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 1591548
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 4427 out of 1595975 non-N bases (0.28%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 1595975 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 4427
