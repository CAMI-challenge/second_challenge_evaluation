CONTIG: PC328638 (5197896bp)
Best alignment score: 4504.0 (LEN: 4504, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 4916.0, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 5192478
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 5418 out of 5197896 non-N bases (0.10%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 5197896 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 5418
