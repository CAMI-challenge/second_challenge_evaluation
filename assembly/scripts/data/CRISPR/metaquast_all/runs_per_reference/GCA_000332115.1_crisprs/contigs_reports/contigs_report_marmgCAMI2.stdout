CONTIG: PC587778 (3914609bp)
Best alignment score: 610.0 (LEN: 610, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 909.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 3913449
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1160 out of 3914609 non-N bases (0.03%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 3914609 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1160
