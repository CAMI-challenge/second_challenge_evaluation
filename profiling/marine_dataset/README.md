## Top Least-TP: taxa that most classifiers missed

Caption: This heatmap shows how similar the number of True Positives (taxids present that were correctly classified) for each metagenomic classifier.  The taxa with the least amount of true positives have their taxids listed on the y-axis, while the classifier names are listed on the x-axis. The y-axis is sorted by the taxa with the least number of True Positives relative to the ground truth (gs_marine_short-filtered).  As the legend indicates, a dark red color indicates that the number of True Positives a classifier calculated is very similar to the ground truth (~100%), while a white or pale red color indicated a large difference in the two numbers. The ground truth (gs_marine_short_filtered) is also shown in the graph for easy comparison between its results and the results of the other classifiers.  there are taxa such as Pseudomonas sp. P1.31 (1699311) and Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeota (1462430) that no classifiers could get. Bracken and mOTUs tend to be able to call taxa that the other cannot. Some methods like CCMetagen and LSHVec do not do well on hard-to-call taxa. It is possible to also look at the most called false positives and negatives with MeTEA as well and provides a useful tool to assess hard-to-call taxa.
